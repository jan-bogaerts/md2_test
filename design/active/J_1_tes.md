**## Goal**




From a card, show every Git commit produced by a root action run started on that card. Selecting a commit shows the card body diff in place of the editor and gives access to other files changed by the commit.




**## Source note**




\`design/architecture/initial description/card\_dif.md\`:




\> Card popup shows diff icon when commits available. All commits done during agent run, done on the card. When clicked, shows context menu with all available commits, labeled \`action + date & time (short)\`. Markdown editor should already support showing diffs; we also have react-diff-viewer-continued.




**## Current state**




F\_055/F\_056 collect \`CommitReference\[]\` for one root action chain, including commits from linked \`onBefore\`/\`on\`/\`onAfter\` actions. Current persistence is unsuitable for card history:




\- action history is split into path-derived, per-action files under the ignored \`logs\` folder — unstable identity (collides after moves/normalization) and stored per-worktree instead of one project-owned location;

\- conversation files are persisted before execution and rewritten \~every 250 ms, even though live rendering uses in-memory events;

\- \`ActionContext\` has the card path but not its stable \`header.internalId\`;

\- \`generateDiff(commitReference)\` renders via \`project.diffCommand\`, and \`DiffView\` already renders whole-commit diffs;

\- card popup and file-mode toolbar have no card commit control;

\- the markdown editor doesn't register MDXEditor's \`diffSourcePlugin\`.




No existing project data or compatibility migration must be supported.




**## Project activity storage**




Activity is project data and must be committed so every collaborator can see it. Replace ignored \`logs\` persistence with tracked files in the **\*\*primary checkout\*\***:




\- card activity: \`\<projectFolder>/activity/card\_\_\<cardInternalId>.json\`;

\- project-origin activity: \`\<projectFolder>/activity/project.json\` (no card id).




One card file owns all action-run and conversation activity for that card, filed by \`header.internalId\` — never path, title, display id, or normalized path prefix.




The renderer adds \`cardInternalId\` to every card/file \`ActionContext\`; a card-origin execution without it fails before starting. The root execution snapshots its origin once; child actions inherit it even in another worktree.




Each completed root execution appends one \`ActionActivityRecord\` with at least:




\- \`executionId\`, start/completion timestamps, terminal status;

\- root action \`id\` and snapshotted \`label\`;

\- origin kind and, for card origin, \`cardInternalId\`;

\- all commit references from the root and child actions, in execution order;

\- conversation ids created by that execution.




Each commit reference keeps full hash, timestamp, source branch, changed paths/counts, and performer action id/label when different from the root action — never a filesystem path for card ownership. Absolute \`repositoryRoot\` paths are machine-local and must not be required in tracked activity data.




All reads/writes use the primary project root, even for actions executed in a linked worktree. A project-scoped activity writer serializes read-modify-write, writes atomically, then commits only the changed activity file via \`commitTrackedPaths\` — after action commit collection, and not itself added to the activity record.




**## Conversation persistence**




Running conversations stay in \`AgentRunnerService\` memory; structured events keep streaming directly to the live UI.




Write the conversation to its activity file once, when the turn reaches \`completed\`, \`failed\`, or \`cancelled\` — finishing the atomic write before the terminal \`closed\` event publishes. Remove initial and throttled intermediate writes.




A hard crash may lose the unfinished turn; completed/failed/cancelled turns remain persisted. Continuation only reads terminally persisted conversations; concurrent turns for one conversation stay forbidden.




**## Commit visibility**




Commits made in a linked worktree are visible through the primary checkout (shared Git object database), so diff commands run from the primary repository root with the stored hash.




For each stored commit:




\- show it when reachable from primary branch HEAD;

\- before merge, also show it when its source branch belongs to a currently valid linked worktree and the commit is reachable from that branch;

\- once its worktree is no longer valid/registered and it's unreachable from primary HEAD, treat it as discarded and hide it (record stays in activity);




Supports the app's normal full-branch merge flow only — no inference across patches, rebases, squash merges, or cherry-picks. Ancestry is used solely to tell merged worktree commits from discarded ones after the worktree disappears.




Visibility is re-evaluated on activity load and after project/worktree state changes. A visible hash whose Git object is unavailable locally keeps its row and reports unavailability on selection.




**## Commit menu**




\- \`SourceCommit\` icon in the card popup header, between Dirty/Saved and Close; same control in \`ListEditorToolbarControls\` beside Agents/Properties for file-mode cards.

\- Hidden when no visible commits exist; count badge when more than one.

\- Newest first across activity records, labeled \`\<root action label> · \<short date & time>\` (user locale).

\- Secondary text: short hash and \`+insertions/−deletions\`; full hash as row \`title\`.

\- Reloads after an action execution for this \`cardInternalId\` completes, and after worktree/project state changes.

\- All records persist; no exact UI cap required — a reasonable display limit (e.g. 50) may be applied for performance, with older entries stated as hidden. Paging not required.




**## Picking a commit**




Selecting a commit enters diff mode on that card surface:




\- compares the card file at \`\<commit>^\` vs \`\<commit>\`, each run through \`markdownParsingService.parse(content).body\` so frontmatter is excluded;

\- replaces the live editor visually with a separate read-only \`MarkdownEditor\` (\`diffSourcePlugin\`, \`viewMode: 'diff'\`) — historical content never enters the live editor or its autosave/dirty/history services;

\- shows root action label, full timestamp, short hash, and an **\*\*Exit diff\*\*** control above the diff;

\- first \`Escape\` exits diff mode and keeps the popup open; a second \`Escape\` closes the popup; closing the popup also clears diff mode.




If the commit didn't touch the card's current file path, skip body diff mode and open the other-files list directly (card rename tracking out of scope).




Below the body diff, an **\*\*Also changed (n)\*\*** row lists other changed paths; selecting one opens existing \`DiffView\` for the whole commit, scrolled to that file, with existing \`openInEditor\` line-click behavior.




**## Bridge and renderer changes**




Add action-bridge methods through preload, local dispatch, \`ElectronActionBridge\`, and remote-control proxy:




\- \`loadCardActivity({ cardInternalId }): Promise\<CardActivityFile>\` — reads the primary checkout activity file, validates it, filters commit visibility, returns activity for that card identity;

\- \`readFileAtCommit({ commit, path, parent }): Promise\<{ content: string, exists: boolean }>\` — runs \`git show \<commit>\[^]:\<path>\` from the primary repository root; missing paths, and a missing parent for a root commit, return \`{ content: '', exists: false }\`.




Git paths are repository-relative and pass existing root/path validation. Malformed activity is a visible load error, not silently treated as empty history.




Renderer responsibilities:




\- \`card\_commit\_history.ts\` loads/validates card activity; no execution bridge means no commits;

\- \`use\_card\_commits.ts\` keys requests by \`cardInternalId\`, refreshes on matching root execution completion and worktree/project changes, discards stale async results after card change/unmount;

\- card popup and file mode share \`CardCommitMenu\`/\`CardCommitDiffPanel\`, each with independent diff selection state;

\- historical diff uses a separate read-only editor instance; whether the live editor stays mounted is an implementation detail, but historical content must never enter live editor state or persistence pipelines.




**## Edge cases**




\- No commits from a root run: activity still records the run/conversation; icon stays hidden.

\- Linked actions commit on different worktree branches: one root activity record, visibility evaluated per commit.

\- Worktree commit before merge: visible while worktree valid/registered.

\- Worktree removed after full merge: stays visible (reachable from primary HEAD).

\- Worktree removed without merge: hidden but retained in activity.

\- Commit object unavailable locally: row stays if otherwise visible; selecting shows \`Commit is no longer available in this repository\`.

\- Root commit: old body empty, new body renders as added.

\- Frontmatter-only commit: show \`No body changes in this commit\`, then other changed files.

\- Card renamed after commit: current path may not exist at either revision; show only other changed files.

\- Card deleted or surface closed while loading: discard result.

\- Two local executions update one card: writer serializes writes, keeps separate \`executionId\` records.

\- Two collaborators edit the same tracked activity file on different branches: normal Git conflict handling applies.




**## Acceptance criteria**




\- Activity stored once per card under tracked \`\<projectFolder>/activity\`, keyed by \`cardInternalId\`, written in the primary checkout regardless of execution worktree.

\- One root execution creates one activity record with commits from root + all child actions, plus root action id/label and card identity.

\- No path-prefix aggregation or path-derived card ownership remains.

\- Conversation turns write once at terminal completion/failure/cancellation; live UI keeps streaming from memory.

\- A card with commits from two root executions shows one icon, newest first.

\- Unmerged commits from valid linked worktrees are viewable before merge; remain visible after full merge; hidden if worktree removed unmerged.

\- Selecting a commit that touched the card shows a read-only body diff (first parent vs. commit) without changing dirty/autosave/history state.

\- First \`Escape\` exits diff mode keeping popup open; second \`Escape\` closes popup.

\- Selecting a commit that didn't touch the current card path opens other changed files without entering body diff mode.

\- Other-file diff and VS Code line opening work locally and through remote control.

\- Same menu/diff behavior in card popup and file mode.

\- Missing bridge hides icon; malformed activity reports a visible error.

\- Tests cover: stable-id storage, root/child aggregation, serialized atomic writes, single terminal conversation write, primary/worktree visibility, discarded worktree hiding, full-merge retention, missing commit, root commit, frontmatter-only diff, Escape order, both toolbar hosts, remote proxy, no live-editor persistence side effects.




**## Documentation impact**




Update F\_050/F\_012 conversation persistence wording and F\_056 history ownership/storage wording. No migration or legacy schema support required.
