**## Problem**




The F-047 implementation delivers one Electron action runner with correct chain, \`okButNotAfter\`, and cancellation semantics, but an audit against \`design/architecture/initial description/writings/running\_actions.md\` found 17 contract gaps. This report lists each gap with the exact location, expected behavior, and fix direction so they can be resolved without re-deriving the analysis.




Decisions already taken for this report:




\- Command runs must always write history, not only when a commit line is detected (finding 12 is a bug).

\- Conversation continuation goes through the Electron action runner via an extended start request, not a fake action id (finding 4).

\- Free-prompt agent chat from the conversation panel routes through the builtin \`md2.custom-prompt\` action (finding 4b).




**## Findings**




**### 1. Card \`currentAction\` execution state is not implemented (missing, high)**




Contract ("Card execution state"): a card keeps an in-memory \`currentAction\` while an action runs for it; every action entry point for that card is disabled while set; completion, failure, or cancellation clears it and publishes an execution-state event; nothing is persisted.




Current state: no \`currentAction\` exists anywhere in \`app/src\`. \`app/src/components/actions/action\_entry\_points.tsx\` never disables entry points. The running dot in \`app/src/components/card\_view/project\_card\_view.tsx\` (line \~57, \`isAgentRunning\`) derives from \`card.agentConversations\` status only, so command actions show no running state and a second run can start while one is active.




Fix direction: derive a renderer-side map \`cardPath -> executionId\` from the shared \`onActionExecution\` stream (subscribe once, e.g. in \`AgentIntegration\` or a small dedicated service). Set the entry on the root \`execution\`/\`running\` event, clear on terminal events (\`completed\`, \`failed\`, \`cancelled\`, \`okButNotAfter\`). Requires the event to carry \`context\` (finding 2) so the card path is known. Disable all \`ActionEntryPoints\` variants and the popup \`Run\`/\`Schedule\` buttons for that card while set. On app start the map is empty by construction. Cover with React tests: entry points disabled during run, re-enabled after each terminal status.




**### 2. Execution events do not carry \`context\` (missing, high)**




Acceptance: "Every execution event identifies the root action, current action, context, phase, and execution status."




Current state: \`emit\` in \`desktop/src/actions/action\_runner\_service.js\` (\`emit(execution, action, phase, status, details)\`, \~line 484) publishes \`actionId\`, \`executionId\`, \`phase\`, \`rootActionId\`, \`status\` plus details — no \`context\`. \`ActionExecutionEvent\` in \`app/src/data/action\_run\_types.ts\` has no \`context\` field.




Fix direction: add \`context: execution.context\` to the emitted event object and \`context: ActionContext\` to \`ActionExecutionEvent\`. Extend \`desktop/src/actions/action\_runner\_service.test.mjs\` event assertions. Finding 1 depends on this.




**### 3. Web mode does not disable execution controls with an explanation (missing, high)**




Contract ("Availability and errors"): run, cancel, and live-input controls are disabled with a clear explanation when no Electron execution backend is available; definitions stay editable.




Current state: popup \`Run\` (\`app/src/components/actions/action\_popup.tsx\`) is always enabled; without a bridge, \`runElectronAction\` throws \`Action execution requires Electron\` (\`app/src/services/electron\_action\_runner.ts\` line \~59) which renders as a failed run log only after clicking. Panel \`Start\`/\`Continue\`/\`Send\` in \`app/src/components/agents/agent\_conversation\_list.tsx\` behave the same via thrown errors.




Fix direction: expose a \`hasExecutionBackend\` check (bridge presence, \`getElectronActionBridge() !\=\= null\`; a remote-control browser session still counts as available because it proxies to Electron). Disable \`Run\`, \`Cancel\`, \`Schedule\`, panel \`Start\`/\`Continue\`/\`Send\` and show helper text such as "Action execution requires the Electron desktop app". Add React tests for the disabled state and explanation.




**### 4. Conversation continuation bypasses the Electron action runner (missing, high)**




Contract/F-047: manual, \`onState\`, scheduled, related, and continuation runs all use the one Electron runner; the conversational panel continuation "starts or resumes a linked Electron agent run".




Current state: \`continueConversation\` in \`app/src/services/agent\_conversation\_service.ts\` (lines 160-186) loads the source conversation in the renderer, builds the continue prompt itself (\`buildContinuePrompt\`), and calls the raw \`storage.startAgentConversation\` bridge (\`desktop/src/shell/local\_bridge\_dispatch.js\` lines 181-185). No execution id, no chain semantics, no shared execution events, no card execution state.




Fix direction (decided): extend the runner start request with an optional continuation field, e.g. \`runInput.continueFrom: \<conversation reference>\` (add to \`ALLOWED\_RUN\_INPUT\_FIELDS\` in \`desktop/src/actions/action\_runner\_service.js\`). Electron loads the source conversation by reference, resolves \`nativeSessionId\`, builds the resume command via \`buildResumeAgentCommand\` (or the continue prompt fallback currently in the renderer — move \`buildContinuePrompt\` to Electron), and runs it as an agent action execution with normal events, history, and cancellation. The panel \`Continue\` button then calls \`runElectronAction\` with the action id the conversation belongs to (persist the originating action id in the conversation log so continuation can find it; conversations started before this change can fall back to \`md2.custom-prompt\`). Remove the renderer-side prompt building. The \`startAgentConversation\` bridge remains only for the search-regexp agent unless finding 4b removes the last other caller.




**### 4b. Free-prompt panel chat bypasses the runner (missing, medium)**




\`startAgentConversation\` in \`app/src/services/agent\_integration.ts\` (line 163) and \`AgentConversationList\` \`Start\` run a raw agent process outside the runner.




Fix direction (decided): route panel \`Start\` through \`runElectronAction(BUILTIN\_CUSTOM\_PROMPT, fileContext, { extraPrompt: prompt })\`. The runner already resolves \`md2.custom-prompt\` (it is in the definition registry from \`shared/action\_definitions.mjs\`). Delete \`AgentIntegration.startAgentConversation\` and \`AgentConversationService.startConversation\` once no caller remains.




**### 5. Run popup ignores agent executable availability (missing, medium)**




Contract ("Execution flow"): on app start, check whether the supported Codex and Claude executables are available and enable or disable them accordingly, with a clear explanation.




Current state: availability is only consulted in the action editor (\`app/src/components/actions/action\_agent\_capability\_fields.tsx\` via \`agentCapabilitiesService\`). The run popup agent select (\`app/src/components/actions/action\_agent\_form.tsx\`) lists \`mergeAgentProfiles(...)\` without availability, so an unavailable agent is selectable and fails only at process spawn. The check is also lazy (first editor open), not at app start.




Fix direction: load availability once at startup (e.g. in app bootstrap when the Electron bridge exists) into \`agentCapabilitiesService\`; reuse \`useAgentCapabilities\` in \`use\_action\_popup\_controller.ts\`/\`ActionAgentForm\` to disable unavailable profiles in the run popup with the same \`name — error\` labeling the editor uses. Disable \`Run\` when the selected agent is unavailable.




**### 6. Conversation panel lacks popup parity (missing, medium)**




Contract ("Conversational panel"): the panel shows the active action execution and the same action history available in the popup; command actions show their execution status and log without agent chat controls.




Current state: \`app/src/components/agents/agent\_conversation\_list.tsx\` renders persisted agent conversations only. No action history, and command-action executions are invisible in the panel.




Fix direction: for the active card/file, render (a) the live execution (from the shared event stream / finding 1 state) including command actions with status and log text, and (b) the action run history loaded through the same \`loadActionHistory\` path the popup uses (\`app/src/services/action\_history.ts\`, \`app/src/components/actions/action\_run\_history.tsx\` can be reused). Keep chat input controls only for running agent executions.




**### 7. \`sendActionInput\` bridge is dead code; stdin uses the legacy path (incorrect, medium)**




\`sendActionInput(executionId, input)\` is wired end to end (\`desktop/src/shell/local\_bridge\_dispatch.js\` lines 236-240, preload, remote control) but has no production caller. The panel sends input via \`sendAgentInput(conversation.id, input)\` — this works only because agent run ids equal conversation ids in \`desktop/src/actions/agent\_runner\_service.js\`.




Fix direction: make the panel input for a running action execution call \`sendActionInput(executionId, input)\` (execution id available once findings 1/6 track live executions). Keep \`sendAgentInput\` only while a non-runner agent path exists; after findings 4/4b it should be removable. One stdin path at the end.




**### 8. Popup run state is local component state, not the shared live execution state (incorrect, high)**




Contract: the popup and conversational panel use the same live execution state; running state remains visible.




Current state: \`use\_action\_popup\_controller.ts\` keeps \`runStatus\`/\`runResult\`/\`executionId\` in \`useState\` and gets results from the \`runElectronAction\` promise. Closing the popup mid-run and reopening shows \`idle\`; \`Cancel\` is gone; the run continues with no way to reattach.




Fix direction: keep a renderer-wide live-execution store fed by one \`onActionExecution\` subscription (same store as findings 1/6): \`executionId -> { rootActionId, context, status, logs }\`. The popup controller selects the entry matching its action id + context on mount, so reopening reattaches to a running or recently finished execution. \`runElectronAction\`'s per-call subscription can then be replaced by reads from that store (it currently also races: it subscribes before \`startAction\` resolves and buffers events, a per-call mechanism the store makes unnecessary).




**### 9. No live log streaming in the popup (incorrect, medium)**




\`runElectronAction\` (\`app/src/services/electron\_action\_runner.ts\` lines 82-84) ignores \`running\` events, which carry the streamed stdout/stderr chunks from \`emit(..., 'running', { stdout, stderr, ... })\` in the runner. Logs appear only when a phase ends. Streamed command output currently has no live consumer anywhere in the UI.




Fix direction: with the store from finding 8, append \`running\`-event chunks to the execution's live log and render them in the popup log area (and panel, finding 6) while status is \`running\`. Keep the final phase event as the authoritative complete output.




**### 10. Global indicator double-counts agent actions (incorrect, medium)**




\`app/src/services/agent\_integration.ts\` \`handleActionExecutionEvent\` (lines 295-330): the root \`execution\`/\`running\` event adds a running-agent entry \`Action \<rootActionId>\` via \`startRunningAgent\`, and every embedded \`agentEvent\` with type \`started\` adds a second entry via \`agentConversationService.observeRunEvent\`. One agent action produces two indicator entries; command actions produce one.




Fix direction: one entry per execution. Keep the execution-event entry (works for command and agent actions) and stop calling \`observeRunEvent\` for agent events that belong to an action execution (they carry \`event.executionId\`). \`observeRunEvent\` remains for the non-runner paths until findings 4/4b remove them.




**### 11. Cancelled phases are logged as failed in the popup (incorrect, low)**




\`logFromEvent\` in \`app/src/services/electron\_action\_runner.ts\` (line 44) maps every non-\`completed\` status to \`failed\`, so a \`cancelled\` action event shows as "failed" in the popup log.




Fix direction: preserve the actual status (\`cancelled\` stays \`cancelled\`); widen \`ActionRunLogEntry.status\` accordingly and adjust rendering/colors.




**### 12. Command runs without a commit line write no history (bug, medium — decided)**




\`appendCommandHistory\` in \`desktop/src/actions/action\_runner\_service.js\` (lines 468-476) returns early when \`extractCommitMetadata\` finds no \`\[branch hash]\` line, so ordinary command runs leave no history although acceptance requires history keyed by action id and context.




Fix direction: always append an entry \`{ command, completedAt, output, prompt: '', status }\` and include \`commit\` metadata only when present (mirroring the agent-action entry shape a few lines above). Update runner tests: command run without commit line produces a history entry.




**### 13. Remarkable builtin action is hardcoded inside the runner (design, medium)**




\`REMARKABLE\_CONVERT\_ACTION\` (\`desktop/src/actions/action\_runner\_service.js\` lines 15-36) is special-cased in \`loadRootAction\` by id. \`loadRequestAction\` in \`desktop/src/shell/local\_bridge\_dispatch.js\` (lines 48-65) does not know it, so \`loadActionRunHistory\` for \`md2.convert-remarkable-images-to-text\` throws \`Unknown action\` (latent — no UI currently opens history for it, but the runner writes history entries for it that can never be read back).




Fix direction: move the definition into \`shared/action\_definitions.mjs\` as a builtin next to \`BUILTIN\_CUSTOM\_PROMPT\` and include it in the registry/actions list returned by \`validateActionDefinitionGraph\` (with duplicate-id protection like the custom prompt). Delete the runner special case; both \`loadRootAction\` and \`loadRequestAction\` then resolve it naturally. Keep it out of entry-point listings via its \`appliesTo\`/\`builtin\` handling in the renderer (verify \`actionsForContext\` filtering).




**### 14. Duplicate definition-loading logic in desktop main (design, medium)**




\`ActionRunnerService.loadRootAction\` and \`local\_bridge\_dispatch.loadRequestAction\` both load action files, validate with \`loadActionDefinitions\`, sanitize errors, and find by id — with drift already (builtin handling differs; dispatch requires the renderer to send \`actionsFolder\`, the runner owns its own from \`startProject\`).




Fix direction: extract one resolver (e.g. \`desktop/src/actions/action\_definition\_resolver.js\`) taking \`(localGitService, project, actionsFolder, profiles, actionId)\` and use it from both call sites. Prefer the runner's owned \`actionsFolder\` for history requests too, so the renderer stops sending it (\`ActionRunHistoryRequest\`), tightening the Electron boundary.




**### 15. \`extractCommitMetadata\`/\`COMMIT\_LINE\_PATTERN\` duplicated across processes (design, low)**




Identical logic exists in \`desktop/src/actions/action\_runner\_service.js\` (lines 10, 115-129) and \`app/src/services/action\_history.ts\` (lines 11-38). They will drift.




Fix direction: move the pattern and parser into \`shared/\` (like \`shared/agent\_profiles.mjs\`) and import from both sides; keep the small input-shape differences (\`project.rootPath\` requirement) at the call sites. Check whether the renderer copy still has callers after findings 4/4b — if not, delete it instead.




**### 16. \`okButNotAfter\` has no distinct presentation (design, low)**




\`statusColor\` in \`app/src/components/actions/action\_popup\_defaults.ts\` (lines 64-70) falls through to \`text.secondary\` for \`okButNotAfter\`; the state is distinguishable only by its raw text. The panel/conversation chips (\`agent\_conversation\_list.tsx\` \`statusColor\`) have no such state at all.




Fix direction: give \`okButNotAfter\` an explicit color (warning.main) and a human label ("Completed, after-actions failed") wherever run status renders (popup status, history entries, panel once finding 6 lands).




**### 17. \`onState\` trigger detection lives in the renderer (design, documented limitation)**




\`triggerStateActions\` in \`app/src/services/agent\_integration.ts\` (lines 227-237) detects card state changes and calls \`runElectronAction\`, so execution is Electron-owned (acceptance met) but triggering only happens while the app runs with a loaded snapshot; a state change written by an external process fires nothing.




Fix direction: no code change required by the contract. Record it as an accepted limitation in \`running\_actions.md\` ("Application-level triggers") — note: modifying that architecture document needs explicit approval first. If instead triggers should move to Electron, that is a separate feature (Electron would need card-state diffing on \`watchProject\` events).




**## Suggested fix order**




1\. Finding 2 (event \`context\`) — small, unblocks 1, 6, 8.

2\. Findings 8 + 9 + 1 — one shared live-execution store in the renderer feeds popup reattach, live logs, and card \`currentAction\`.

3\. Findings 3, 5 — availability/backend gating in popup and panel.

4\. Findings 12, 11, 16 — small correctness/presentation fixes, independent.

5\. Findings 4, 4b, 7, 10 — continuation and free chat through the runner, then collapse stdin paths and indicator double-count (10's guard can land earlier using \`executionId\` presence).

6\. Findings 13, 14, 15 — desktop-side refactors, independent of the UI work.

7\. Finding 17 — documentation only, needs doc-change approval.




**## Test plan**




\- Desktop: runner emits \`context\` on every event; command run without commit line writes history; continuation request resolves resume command in Electron and rejects an unknown conversation reference; remarkable builtin resolvable by both runner and history loader; shared resolver unit tests.

\- React: entry points and popup controls disabled while a card runs and re-enabled per terminal status; popup reattaches to a running execution after reopen; live log chunks render while running; cancelled phase shows cancelled; web mode shows disabled controls with explanation; run popup disables unavailable agents; indicator shows exactly one entry per running execution; panel shows command execution status and popup-equivalent history; panel input routes through \`sendActionInput\`.

\- Run \`npm run lint\` and \`npm run test\` in \`app/\` and \`desktop/\`, plus \`npm run typecheck\` in \`app/\`.
